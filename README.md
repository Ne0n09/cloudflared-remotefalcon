# cloudflared-remotefalcon

[Remote Falcon](https://remotefalcon.com/) is an awesome project and I thought I would give back by creating a simplified way to run Remote Falcon for those who would like to self host beyond just these [ways](https://docs.remotefalcon.com/docs/developer-docs/running-it/methods).

[cloudflared-remotefalcon](https://github.com/Ne0n09/cloudflared-remotefalcon/tree/main) helps you self host [Remote Falcon](https://remotefalcon.com/) with guided setup and configuration using [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) and your own server capable of running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) through the use of various helper [scripts](https://ne0n09.github.io/cloudflared-remotefalcon/scripts/).

To get started check out the [documentation](https://ne0n09.github.io/cloudflared-remotefalcon/)!

I try to keep release notes of updates I make to the scripts and files available [here](https://ne0n09.github.io/cloudflared-remotefalcon/release-notes/)
