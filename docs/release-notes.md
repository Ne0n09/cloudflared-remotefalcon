## 2025.1.4.1

- Everything with regards to the compose.yaml files and configuration script has been updated. The two compose.yaml scripts for published and non-published ports have been removed to just the single compose.yaml with plugins-api port 8083 published. This is exactly how I have run RF for the 2024 season without any issues. 

- Updated the configure-rf script to run outside of the 'remotefalcon' directory. It will also auto create the 'remotefalcon' directory if it is not found in the current directory.

- Added two update scripts. These scripts will display a list of changes in newer versions compared to your current container version and ask you to update. The scripts will directly modify your compose.yaml to update the image tag to the new version versus tagging the containers to 'latest'

- The update_containers.sh script can be run directly with:

!!! example "Update containers syntax"

    ```sh
      ./update_containers.sh [all|mongo|minio|nginx|cloudflared] [dry-run|auto-apply|interactive] [health]
    ```

!!! example "Update specific container"

    ```
      ./update_containers.sh cloudflared auto-apply health
      ‚öôÔ∏è Checking for non-RF container updates...
      ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
      üîÑ Container: cloudflared
      üî∏ Current version: 2025.5.0
      üîπ Latest version: 2025.5.0
      ‚úÖ cloudflared is up-to-date.
      üöÄ Done. Non-RF container update process complete.
    ```

- Added health check script that gets called from the configure-rf.sh script and the update scripts.

- The health_check.sh script can be run directly with:

    `#!sh ./health_check.sh`

- The health check will check/display the following:

  - sudo docker ps -a

  - Remote Falcon endpoints

  - SSL certificate and private key match validation

  - Nginx configuration

  - Any shows configured on Remote Falcon in the format of the show URL.
