## Updating Remote Falcon images

Run the [update_containers](../scripts/index.md#__tabbed_1_2) script:

```sh
./update_containers.sh
```

- The script tags images to the commit from the [Remote Falcon GitHub](https://github.com/Remote-Falcon).

- If any newer changes are found from the current container(s) commit tag they will be displayed along with a prompt to update the container(s).

- If the tags are current the script will let you know there are no updates.

- When an update is accepted, a backup of your current compose.yaml is created and placed in the `remotefalcon-backups` directory.

- This allows for versioning of the RF containers and the ability to roll back the [compose.yaml](../architecture/files.md#composeyaml) if an update breaks your Remote Falcon server.

- If [GitHub](../main/install/github.md) is configured the images will be pulled from GHCR if they exist or they can be built manually if they do not exist.

- Otherwise the images are built locally.

## Updating Mongo, MinIO, NGINX, and Cloudflared containers

Run the [update_containers](../scripts/index.md#__tabbed_1_2) script: 

```sh 
./update_containers.sh
```

- Displays the latest available releases for the containers.

- If an update is available a prompt will be displayed to update along with a link to the release notes.

- When an update is accepted, a backup of your current compose.yaml is created and place in the remotefalcon-backups directory.

- The script directly checks the versions in the containers themselves so it does not rely on the image tags in the [compose.yaml](../architecture/files.md#composeyaml), but it does update the image tag in order to roll back.

## Updating compose.yaml, .env, and default.conf

Currently there are no automatic updates for these files. Sometimes there are changes or additions that will require an update.

1. The [configure-rf](../../scripts/index.md#__tabbed_1_1) script will print the existing versions on your system when it runs:
```sh
ðŸ“œ Existing file versions:
ðŸ”¸ compose.yaml              2025.5.27.1
ðŸ”¸ .env                      2025.5.27.1
ðŸ”¸ default.conf              2025.5.27.1
```
You can check the [release notes](../release-notes.md) to see if there any updates or view the files directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ne0n09/cloudflared-remotefalcon/tree/main/remotefalcon) looking for any `# VERSION` comments towards the top of each script.

2. Run the command below to manually backup to `remotefalcon-backup` and remove the compose.yaml, .env, and default.conf files:
```sh
timestamp=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S'); for f in remotefalcon/{compose.yaml,.env,default.conf}; do cp "$f" "remotefalcon-backups/$(basename "$f").backup-$timestamp" && rm "$f"; done
```

    !!! warning

        Ensure you have a current backup of your .env variables:
        ```sh
        ls -la remotefalcon-backups
        ```
    
3. Run the [configure-rf](../../scripts/index.md#__tabbed_1_1) script to re-download the files and to re-configure your .env variables:
```sh
./configure-rf.sh
```
