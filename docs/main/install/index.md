Assuming that you meet the [prerequisites](../prerequisites.md), installation is broken into two steps:

1. [Cloudflare](../install/cloudflare.md)

2. [Remote Falcon](../install/remotefalcon.md)

It is recommended to start with Cloudflare, but nothing is stopping you from starting with the Remote Falcon installation to get a feel for the install scripts. 

You will just be missing some critical pieces to make it work properly.
